# The East Bay & Transit Oriented Developments {-}

**A Study of the Bay Area Rapid Transit and the Major Cities in the Eastern part of the San Francisco Bay Area**

The San Francisco Bay Area's East Bay Housing Crisis is the resulting clash of strict land-use regulations, racial housing discrimination, and missing regional government with the explosive growth of the technology industry. This mismatch has led to increasing rent, homelessness, and *'gentrification'* on a crisis-level scale.

Even though the Bay Area's economy has grew to become the [18th largest economy in the world in 2017][1], the housing market has not. Also ratified in 2017 was the region's [Plan Bay Area 2040][2] â€” which had bay area cities set 2040 housing targets. Two cities at the heart of the plan, Oakland and Berkeley, are already forecasted to meet their 2040 targets [far beyond 2070][3]. 

> "Every single county is over-performing its job forecast, some by massive amounts, and every single county is under-performing its housing forecast, almost all by a wide margin,"
>
>  --- *MTC director Steve Heminger in his [report to the Association of Bay Area Governments executive board][4]*

The East Bay has been at the center of this mismatch, especially for the urban corridor [Figure 1] of Oakland, Berkeley, and immediate surrounding cities: Alameda, Piedmont, Albany, & Emeryville. The urban East Bay, between the 2009 and 2019 American Community Surveys, added 62,869 residents (10% increase) but could only add 799 occupied housing units (.003% increase). This mismatch of added population without a real increase in units suggests two questions to follow throughout the study: 
 + Where are new residents locating? Are they living in new or old units?  
 + What variables describe the change in new or old residents between 2009 and 2019?

The following study examines some of the surface level indicators of the housing crisis and its resulting displacement. The study will focus on Transit Oriented Developments around Bay Area Rapid Transit stations --- specifically, to understand if TOD housing is relieving the housing crisis or exacerbating the displacement of local residents. The study will: (Section \@ref(section1)) establish the variables and parameters; (Section \@ref(section2)) spatially compare five American Community Survey (ACS) variables between 2009 and 2019; (Section \@ref(section3) & Section \@ref(section4)) make overall comparisions of TOD and non-TOD areas; (Section \@ref(section5)) utilize graduated symbol maps to evaluate specific station TOD areas; (Section \@ref(section6)) compare the distance to BART to both Mean Rent and the Amount of Homeless Encampment complaints; and, finally, (Section \@ref(section7)) evaluate all of the study components to give a picture of the East Bay housing crisis.

# Variables & Parameters {#section1}

This study is bringing in three primary data sources: (\@ref(section1A)) the San Francisco Bay Area's hybrid subway-commuter rail, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), to find TOD areas; (\@ref(section1B)) American Community Survey (ACS) Variables & Census Tracts to get core information; and (\@ref(section1C)) bring in Homeless Encampment complaints from the City of Oakland's 311 citizen hotline.

## Transit Routes & Stops {#section1A}

This study's use of BART allows a focus on both urban centers and their immediate suburbs. The data was sourced from the regional [Metropolitan Transportation Commission](https://opendata.mtc.ca.gov/ "MTC Open Data Portal").

      route_s_nm)
  ) %>%
  st_transform(., 2227)

# Projection is (NAD83) California State Plan, Zone 2 (in FEET)

#cat(CA_crs$input, ', EPSG:', CA_crs$epsg)

BART.routes = 
  st_read(route_path) %>%
  filter(agency_id == "BA", route_s_nm!="Blue-Sun") %>%
  mutate(
    route_s_nm = ifelse(
      route_s_nm=="Blue-Wkd/Sat", "Blue", 
      route_s_nm)
  ) %>%
  st_transform(., CA_crs)

# NARROW STOPS TO .5 MILE OUTSIDE THESE CITIES
BART.stops =
  BART.stops %>%
  # .5 mile buffer + 1 foot
  st_filter(., st_buffer(st_union(EB.cities), dist=5280*.5+1)) %>%
  group_by(stop_nm,stop_id) %>%
  st_drop_geometry(.) %>%
  summarise(
    route_count = n_distinct(route_s_nm), # get routes used
    routes      = list(unique(route_s_nm))
  ) %>%
  merge(., BART.stops[,'stop_id'], by='stop_id') %>%
  distinct() %>% # remove duplicates
  st_as_sf()

# NARROW STOPS TO THESE CITIES 
BART.routes = st_intersection(BART.routes, st_buffer(st_union(EB.cities),5280*.5))

```

The BART stations will serve as the center of TOD areas --- with the ultimate area being tracts mostly within a Â½ mile buffer of BART. See Figure 1.1 & 1.2 in Section \@ref(section1B), for a graphical understanding of this selection.

## American Community Survey Census Tracts {#section1B}

This study is using Census Tracts & Transit stations in the urban area of the Eastern San Francisco Bay Area *"East Bay"*: Oakland, Berkeley, and the immediate suburban cities of Alameda, Albany, Emeryville, and Albany.

The census tracts are for the ACS years of 2009 and 2019 -- which allows us to have a 10-year comparision. There are 6 primary variables that are pulled from the ACS, which can all be seen in Sections \@ref(section3) & \@ref(section4), or listed below:
 + Total Population (\@ref(section5A)), 
 + Median Gross Rent *(includes Utilities costs)* (\@ref(section2B) & \@ref(section5B)),
 + People per Occupied Housing Unit (\@ref(section2A));
 + Percent of Income Spent on Rent (\@ref(section2C));
 + Percent of Residents between the ages of 22 and 34 (\@ref(section2D)); and
 + Percent of Residents Employed in the Information industry *(e.g. Software, Technology, Media)* (\@ref(section2E)).

The TOD census tracts need to meet at least one of the two following requirements: (1) at least 50% of the tract's land area is within the Â½ mile BART station buffers, or (2) at least 25% of the land area is within the Â½ mile buffer (but that tract's buffer area is above .075 square miles). The second requirement accommodates TOD tracts that show the direct impacts from their transit proximity -- but have a geometry that is large enough to prevent them from being a majority within the Â½ mile buffer. 

Figure 1.2 highlights the 3 methods to narrow down TOD tracts --- with the selected tracts being highlighted with black outlines.

## Homeless Encampment Complaints {#section1C}

Since it is difficult to quantify a direct, spatial count of homelessness, a placeholder variable will be used: the amount of complaints about homeless encampments made by citizens to the City of Oakland's 311 citizen outreach. This data will be visualized in the graduated symbol maps of Section \@ref(section6A).

# Five Time & Space Maps {#section2}
***Comparing TOD & non-TOD Tracts between 2009 & 2019***

These five maps paint a primer of the housing and demographic change between 2009 and 2019 in the East Bay. 

## People per Unit {#section2A}
*Total Population per Occupied Housing Units*

Figure 2.1 is the first variable that highlights the overall building and housing conditions of the East Bay. Both the 2009 and 2019 maps highlight the general characteristics of the building density and housing stock: there is more multiple family housing (4+ people per unit)
in the areas closer to BART stations and more single family housing farther away from the stations. Of note is the extremely high residents per unit (20+ people) in Berkeley to the university's student housing. Another important note is the extremely low density, un-changing hills of East Berkeley and Oakland -- where the high elevation, large stock of single-family housing, and aging residents makes it difficult to add density.  

Between 2009 and 2019, we don't see too much of a change in location -- just a general increase in residents per housing unit. At the same time, West Berkeley, Emeryville, and Far-South Oakland all see an increase from 1.5 people per unit to almost 4 people per unit; this is likely the result of many industrial buildings being converted to apartments.

## Rent {#section2B}
*Household Median Rent & Utilities Cost (Adjusted to 2019 inflation)*

The East Bay's median gross rent reveals a dramatic jump in rent in a 10 year period --- even adjusting for the 2019 inflation. A dramatic change is the areas of lower income rent -- Downtown Oakland, Fruitvale, Emeryville, and West Berkeley -- all seeing a $500 to $1,000 increase in rent. West Berkeley & Emeryville's dramatic increase in rent and people per unit suggest a drastic change. Most of the immediate TOD tracts have increases, but not unique to the overal increase; so is there a demand for non-TOD housing in the West?.

```{r 2B, fig.cap="Median Rent"}

variable  = "med_rent_inf"

## Income spent on Rent {#section2C}
*Percent of Median Household Income spent on Rent*

This map of the percent of income spent on rent suggests a large change in personal finances and/or population in many areas of the city. The noticeable change is the actual *decrease* in the percent of income spent on rent -- especially West Berkeley, Emeryville, West Oakland, and South Oakland.

Even though it initially appears optimistic that more residents are affording rent, it starts to turn pessimistic when recalling the sharp rise in rent in Figure 2.2. For West Berkeley, Emeryville, and West Oakland, the large increase in rent combined with less income going towards rent suggests the introduction of new units and wealthier residents. One tract in particular on the farthest tip of West Oakland goes from 43% of income going towards rent to only 19% -- with a rise of median rent going from $1,552 to $2,750 in that same period.


```{r 2C, fig.cap="Income on Rent"}

## Young Adults {#section2D}
*Percent of People between the ages of 22 and 34 compared to total people*

The percent of young adults (Figure 2.4) highlights concentrations of young adults (above 30%). At the same time, the aging Oakland/Berkeley Hills population and the low-income families of South Oakland & Fruitvale retain the same age composition in this period. This map locates the 'young urban professionals' who have money, fewer responsibilities, and an ability to move to their location of choice. Northern TOD tracts and West Berkeley seem to receive the largest growth in young adults. The underlying complication of this map is remembering the East Bay's .003% increase in units for the 10% increase of population during this period.

## Employees of Tech & Software companies {#section2E}
*Percent of Employed People in the Information Industry (e.g. Technology, Software, Media) compared to Total Employed People*

This map of the employees of the technology, software and media (Figure 2.5) strikes at the heart of the Bay Area's booming economy, pricing-out, and 'gentrification'. There is an increase of tech employees in the previously mentioned young and wealthy areas: Northern TOD tracts, West Berkeley, West Oakland, and Emeryville. At the same time, tech employees start to encroach on the neighborhoods of the typically low-income households: Fruitvale, Downtown Oakland, and West Oakland.

# Bar Plot {#section3}
*One grouped bar plot making these same comparisons*

The Bar Plots (Figure 3.1) highlight that there is a completely different narrative for TOD and non-TOD tracts. To start, population has been practically stagnant for non-TOD tracts -- with an addition of 36,029 residents (a 0.07% increase); meanwhile, there was an increase of 26,840 TOD residents (a 24% increase). In a similar pattern, TOD tracts received relative jumps in the amount of young adults and tech employees, while the non-TOD tracts lied dormant. Overall, both TOD and non-TOD saw increases in rent and people per unit.

# Graduated Symbol Maps {#section5}

The population graduated symbols (Figure 5.1) highlight the lack of lack of real population growth and the higher amount of population that is closer to TOD in North Oakland and Berkeley. Downtown Oakland, West Oakland, and the South Oakland stations don't have as much population -- likely due to the large amount of commercial and industrial space next to the stations.

# Rent, Homelessness, & Distance to BART {#section6}

In the following plots, the study's focus will temporarily narrow down to the City of Oakland and the years of 2009, 2014, and 2019. The scope allows the use of the City of Oakland's 311 citizen request service -- specifically looking at requests to remove homeless encampments. Homelessness in the Bay Area has increased tremendously in the past 20 years -- with rising rents being a considerable cause. 

In Figure 6.1, both the rent and amount of homeless encampment requests are compared to the distance of BART. Specifically, there is a significant rise in rent and requests to remove homeless encampments over the last 10 years. For rent and distance to BART, rent increases with distance to BART -- likely due to the larger house sizes in the Oakland Hills, the small amount of tracts that are over 2.5 miles from BART, and the small amount of units for rent father from BART. The increase in rent between 2014 and 2019 is very noticeable, regardless of distance to BART.

For requests to remove homeless encampments, it is noticeably higher closer to BART. This is likely due to the larger amount of open space, transportation options, and resources closer to Downtown and the bay. Like rent, there is a noticeable jump in homelessness requests from 2014 to 2019. 

Taking in all 311 requests (e.g. Illegal Dumping, Littering, Abandoned cars) into account, the homeless encampment requests' increase went far beyond the all requests -- with all requests increasing by 83% from 2014 to 2019, but homeless requests increasing by 330%. 

Looking at Figure 6.2, the homeless encampments locate themselves on the bay shores and along the BART routes. This likely is to maximize the open land (compared to the low density of the hills) and the amount of resources close to higher density transit areas.

# Policy Brief {#section7}

The study's examination of the East Bay's Housing Crisis suggest the lack of housing units allow higher income, younger tech employees to *out price* the local residents. The five variable maps in Section \@ref(section2) suggest this narrative. The table of Section \@ref(section4) and the population/units maps of Section \@ref(section5) highlight that the non-TOD tracts have been stagnant on their housing production -- leading to higher competition and prices of the smaller housing stock. The BART stations themselves are a magnet to density and general interests -- suggesting that there should be an evaluation to expand BART and TOD.
